# table-of-contents-wordpress
Auto table of contents code for Wordpress blog posts

Put the code into your functions.php.
The blog content needs to be in this form:

```
<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ....
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ...
</section>
```

This little plugin / function will highlight all sections that are currently in the browser viewport. So, typically, 2 or even 3 sections titles will be highlighted.
