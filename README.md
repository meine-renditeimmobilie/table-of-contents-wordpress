# table-of-contents-wordpress
Auto table of contents code for Wordpress blog posts

Put the code of toc-wp-php into your functions.php.
The blog posts content needs to be in this form:

```
<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ....
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ...
</section>
```

This little plugin / function will highlight all sections that are currently in the browser viewport. So, typically, 2 or even 3 sections titles will be highlighted at once. 

The TOC HTML markup is saved on each post save. If there were no changes to the post (post not saved), it'll pull the existing TOC HTML from the database. The changes in the post content itself are made on the fly. So, no changes to the post content are made. Apart from the HTML structure outlined above, no manual insertion of anything is needed. The ID's for the links are contructed from the text content of the first <h2> tag inside each <section> tag.

If you're using a page builder, your HTML will most likely look (vastly) different. In that case you'd have to either adapt the output of the page builder or the code in toc-wp.php to match the HTML generated by your page builder.
