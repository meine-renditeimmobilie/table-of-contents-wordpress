# table-of-contents-wordpress
Auto table of contents code for Wordpress blog posts

Put the code of toc-wp-php into your functions.php.
The blog posts content needs to be in this form:

```
<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ....
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Section title here</h2>
  ...
</section>
```

This little plugin / function will highlight all sections that are currently in the browser viewport. So, typically, 2 or even 3 sections titles will be highlighted. 

If you're using a page builder your HTML will most likely look different. In that case you'd have to either adapt the output of the page builder or the code in toc-wp.php to match the HTML generated by your page builder.
